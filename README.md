# Vite-TypeScript-Redux (Pomeranian Start.IT Project)

## About
This is an app that we made in extra classes during the [Pomeranian course](https://pomeranianstartit.pl/). 

While working on it, we learned about many tools such as:
- React Query,
- Redux-Persist,
- Radix UI.

In addition, we repeated the main themes of Redux and learned about the many types of TypeScript.
